# Olden Era — Simple Template Generator

> **⚠️ Disclaimer**  
> This project was mostly built with GitHub Copilot. The goal was to quickly create a tool for generating random map templates with custom settings to play with friends — not to produce a polished, production-ready application. As a result, some edge cases may not be handled perfectly and bugs are to be expected. Features marked as **[EXPERIMENTAL]** in the UI have not been thoroughly tested and may produce broken or unplayable maps.

## What is this?

A small Windows desktop tool that generates `.rmg.json` random map templates for **Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era**. Instead of editing JSON by hand, you configure your map settings through a simple UI and click **Generate Template**.

---

## Features

### General

- Configure **template name**, **player count** (2–8), and **map size**
- Experimental map sizes available via an opt-in checkbox
- **Update check** — notifies you on startup if a newer version is available on GitHub and opens the releases page for manual install
- Automatically detects your **Olden Era install path** via Steam registry and opens the Save dialog in the correct `map_templates` folder
- **Preview image** — generate a visual overview of the zone layout before saving; optionally save it in the template directory for in-game display

### Hero Settings

- Configure **minimum hero count**, **maximum hero count**, and the **per-castle increment**  
  *(defaults: 4 min / 8 max / 1 increment)*

### Map Layout (Topology)

- **Random** — zones placed at random and connected to all neighbouring zones (Delaunay-based)
- **Ring** — zones arranged in a circle, each connected to its two neighbours
- **Chain** — zones connected in a straight line
- **Hub** *(Experimental)* — all zones connect to a shared central hub
  - Configurable **hub zone size** (0.25× – 3×)

### Zone Configuration

- Set **castles per player zone** and **castles per neutral zone**
- Configure **resource spawn rate**, **structure density**, **neutral stack strength**, and **border guard strength**
- **Match player castle factions** — player zones receive a faction-locked castle to match their chosen faction

#### Advanced Settings

Unlock additional controls via the **Advanced settings** checkbox:

- **Player zone size** and **neutral zone size** multipliers (0.5× – 2×)
- **Guard strength randomization** percentage
- **Advanced neutral zone breakdown** — independently configure counts of low/medium/high quality neutral zones, with and without castles (up to 32 total zones in advanced mode)

### Portal & Connectivity Options

- **Always spawn portals** — adds portal connections between non-adjacent zones, with a configurable **max portal connections** limit
- **Generate roads** — adds road objects between connected zones
- **Spawn remote footholds** — places remote footholds in each castle zone
- **Isolate player zones** *(Random layout only)* — players can only reach each other through neutral zones
- **Balanced zone placement** — attempts to distribute zones more evenly across the map

### Game Rules

- **Victory condition** — choose between standard and alternative win conditions
- **Faction Laws experience** and **Astrology experience** multipliers

### Win Conditions

#### Lose when starting city is lost
#### Lose when starting hero is lost

#### City Hold
Players must capture and hold a designated city for a set number of days to win.

- The city location is chosen automatically based on topology:
  - **Hub** — the hub zone becomes the hold city
  - **Other layouts** — the highest-quality neutral zone that is maximally equidistant from all players is attempted to be selected
- The hold city is highlighted with a **golden house icon** in the preview image
- Generation is blocked if no valid city zone can be determined

#### Tournament Mode
A special competitive mode designed for 1v1 play with an isolated preparation phase.

- **Only available with exactly 2 players** — generation is blocked otherwise
- Each player starts in a **completely isolated cluster** of zones; it is impossible to reach the opponent until the tournament begins
- Neutral zones are **balanced by quality tier** across both players (each side gets the same mix of low/medium/high zones)
- Zone order within each cluster is **randomised** but **mirrored** — both players experience the same layout
- Supports multiple topologies:
  - **Chain / Ring** — two mirrored isolated chains
  - **Random** — two mirrored isolated Delaunay-like clusters
  - **Hub** — each player gets their own private hub cluster (respects hub zone size setting)
- Configure: **first tournament day**, **announcement lead time**, **tournament interval**, and **points needed to win**
